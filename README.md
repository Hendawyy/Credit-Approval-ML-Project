# Credit Approval Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a machine learning project for credit approval prediction. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and accuracy assessment using various classification models.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset from 'CRX.csv' and performs data cleaning and preprocessing to make it suitable for credit approval prediction tasks.

## Models

The following classification models are used in this project:

- K-Nearest Neighbours
- Random Forest Classifier
- Bagging Classifier
- Extra Trees Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier

Each model is trained on the dataset, and the model's score and accuracy on the test data are evaluated.
